It is becoming increasingly apparent to me that the field of data visualization is really concerned with conveying the truth. Data visualizations are meant to show information to the reader. Just as elements of design can be used to make it _easier_ for the reader to reach the correct conclusion, elements of design can be used to mislead the reader an incorrect conclusion.
Tufte suggests that the silver bullet for testing whether a graphic is misleading or not is to test the graphic on people!
