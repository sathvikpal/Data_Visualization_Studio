This week our class read the first two chapters of Alberto Cairo's new book, How Charts Lie. As a scientist-in-training myself, I would like to think that I am pretty good at reading and interpreting charts, but a little tune-up never hurts. I had actually read on NPR about the visual that Cairo opens with, the infamous map of the territory that Trump had conquered but I never paid attention the the words that were associated with the map. I have to admit that I didn't recognize the fallacy in the map how  When we are taught how to read graphs and charts in science classes, we are actually taught to ignore most of the words and try to interpret the charts _a priori_.
